## ðŸ”§ **UPLOAD ISSUE FIXED!**

### **Changes Made:**
1. **Updated CORS Configuration**: Added explicit allowed headers for file uploads
2. **Removed Manual Content-Type**: Let axios handle multipart form data automatically  
3. **Added Upload Timeout**: 30-second timeout for large files
4. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Better debugging information

### **Test the Upload Now:**

1. **Open**: http://localhost:5173/login
2. **Login**: 
   - Email: `test@test.com`
   - Password: `test123`
3. **Go to Profile**: Click on your name or navigate to Profile
4. **For Profile Photo Upload**:
   - Click "Upload Photo" button
   - Select an image (under 5MB, JPG/PNG/WebP)
   - Should upload successfully

5. **For Consultation Photo Upload**:
   - Scroll to "Photos for Dermatologist Consultation"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Select at least one concern checkbox first!
   - Add optional notes
   - Click "Upload Consultation Photo"
   - Select an image (under 10MB, JPG/PNG/WebP)
   - Should upload successfully

### **What Should Happen:**
- âœ… File dialog opens when clicking upload buttons
- âœ… Progress indicator shows "Uploading..."
- âœ… Success message appears
- âœ… Photo appears in the interface
- âœ… Server logs show upload details

### **If Still Having Issues:**
1. **Check Browser Console** (F12 â†’ Console) for detailed error messages
2. **Try with a small image** (under 1MB) first
3. **Refresh the page** and try again
4. **Make sure you're logged in** - try logging out and back in

### **Technical Fix Details:**
- Fixed CORS to allow Content-Type and Authorization headers
- Removed manual Content-Type header (axios sets this automatically for FormData)
- Added 30-second timeout for uploads
- Enhanced server-side logging for debugging

The upload functionality should now work correctly! The key is that **consultation photos require selecting at least one concern** before uploading.
